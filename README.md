# Context
This React template code is taken from codespaces in github. Only change present in App.jsx, go and see the file.

This repository is the creation of simple website using React Framework integration with FastAPI and PosgresSQL.

We are just calling a get api to get details of List from PosgresSQL through FastAPI and show in UI.

UI will display the list of data along with some ordered list category.

This is done for basic understanding and workflow of React, FastAPI and PosgresSQL integration.
